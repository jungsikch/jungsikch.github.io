<h1>Jungsik Choi</h1>
<p>I am a staff researcher at the Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT),
  Samsung's R&D hub that incubates cutting-edge technologies.
  As a member of the Green Supercomputer Project (GSP) & System Semicondoctor T/F at SAIT,
  I focus on developing system software and architectural features
  for the upcoming high performance computing environment.
  Currently, I am designing and implementing runtime and operating systems
  to efficiently manage large amounts of data on emerging devices
  such as CXL memory, PIMs, NPUs, and GPUs.</p>
<p>Prior to joining SAIT,
  I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI),
  a national research institute,
  and Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU).</p>
<p>I also received my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from SKKU in 2019.</p>
