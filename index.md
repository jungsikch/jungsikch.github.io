# Jungsik Choi
I am a Staff Researcher at the [Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT)](https://www.sait.samsung.co.kr/),
Samsung's R&D hub that incubates cutting-edge technologies.
As a member of the Green Supercomputer Project (GSP) & System Semicondoctor T/F at SAIT,
I focus on developing system software and architectural features
for the upcoming high performance computing environment.
Currently, I am designing and implementing runtime and operating systems
to efficiently manage large amounts of data on emerging devices
such as CXL memory, PIMs, NPUs, and GPUs.
Prior to joining SAIT,
I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI)](https://www.etri.re.kr/eng/main/main.etri),
a national research institute,
and [Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU)](https://www.skku.edu).
I also received my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from SKKU in 2019.
